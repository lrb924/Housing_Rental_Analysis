# Module 6 Challenge: Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco

### Package Requirments
`pip install x` where x is the below listed packages
* pandas
* hvplot
* geoviews

### Purpose of Use
* Use data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities. 
* The code is five parts:
  
    1. Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year

        a. Use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.
   
    2. Calculate and Plot the Average Prices per Square Foot
    
        a. Use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the average prices per square foot, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.

    3. Compare the Average Prices by Neighborhood

        a. Use interactive visualizations and widgets to explore the average sale price per square foot by neighborhood.

    4. Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map

        a. Explore the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualizations with hvPlot and GeoViews.

    5. Compose the Data Story

        a. Based on the visualizations that you created, answer the required questions.

### Files Navigation
* `san_francisco_housing.ipynb`: Code explanation, building, data visulaization, interactive visualization, geospatial relationships, and divided by parts
* Resources: Folder containing required csv files containing data
  * `housing_per_year.csv`
  * `neighborhoods_coordinates.csv`
  * `sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv`

### Solution
* After creating the many data visualization tools, a proptech company can determine which neighborhoods contain properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities, and subsequently if there is potential success in running a trial of an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them.
